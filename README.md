# CTF-Writeups
### Here I will document my learning as I explore CTFs (Capture The Flags) in the world of cybersecurity
### I start off as a complete beginner. Seriously, I'm afraid of using the shell.
### I learnt the basic linux commands on TryHackMe before attempting my first CTF  
### This exploration is done on picoCTF, but I'm also doing THM courses and exploring Quantitative Trading strategies in parallel.
